# TEASBench

Uniting Models, Algorithms, and System Innovators with Top-Down Evolutionary Benchmarks

🌐 **Website:** [www.teasbench.com](https://www.teasbench.com)

**TEASBench** is a benchmark suite and toolkit developed to measure the **cost**, **accuracy**, and **performance** of AI inference on **realistic state-of-the-art workloads** running on **diverse hardware architectures**. It is developed in the TEAS (**T**racking **E**volving **A**I and **S**ystems) project funded by **[ARIA](https://aria.org.uk/)** as part of the ["Scaling compute"](https://aria.org.uk/opportunity-spaces/nature-computes-better/scaling-compute/) programme. 

In contrast to benchmarks that use fixed (short) context lengths, TEASBench does not artifically constrain input and output sequences to fixed numbers of tokens.  This enables assessment of accuracy and means TEASBench is more capable of exposing **real-world hardware limitations**. 

TEASBench is continuously evolving to track new and emergent workloads and hardware following a 6-monthly release cycle. The August 2026 release of TEASBench capture recent shifts towards **sparse Mixture-of-Experts**, **reasoning models**, and **agentic tool use**. 

---

## TEASBench Workloads, Models, and Datasets

The benchmarks in this release cover two workload classes / families that jointly characterise contemporary production traffic while stressing inference systems in distinct ways. The first consists of **basic tasks** (single-turn chat) on relatively short input and output contexts. Secondly, to track the state of the art we include a workload based on **reasoning and agentic** workflows. The long outputs, multi-turn structure, and tool-calling traces in this workload yield latency and cost profiles unlike traditional inference workloads. 

The TEAS benchmarks use mostly Mixture of Experts (MoE) models as they represent the majority of state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, as well as a small dense model (`qwen3-4b`) as a low memory requirement control that enables comparison across a wide range of devices. These are served using vLLM or SGLang on a range of GPUs including NVIDIA A100, H100, H200, B200, B300, GB10, AMD MI355X (as well as custom engines for emerging hardware, see [§9](#9-support-for-emerging-hardware)).

| Family/workload | Models | Benchmark Datasets |
|---|---|---|
| moe (basic tasks/single turn) | `gpt-oss-120b`, `qwen3-235b-a22b-instruct-fp8`, `deepseek-r1`, `kimi-k2.5` | `gsm8k`, `arena-hard`, `longbench_v1` |
| agentic (multi-turn, tools) | `gpt-oss-120b`, `deepseek-v3.2` | `imo-answerbench`, `mcp-atlas`, `swe-bench-lite` |

## 1. The TEASBench benchmarking pipeline

The TEASBench pipeline tool provided in this repository encodes many of the settings and parameters used to produce the results shown on the [TEASBench website](https://www.teasbench.com), though does it not cover all cases, for example where part of the software stack used is not yet publicly available or currently somewhat fragile / difficult to standardise on. <!-- link to results repository -->

This README describes how to use the TEASBench pipeline provided in this repository to run the TEAS benchmark experiments on a Kubernetes (K8s) GPU cluster such as EIDF (the [Edinburgh International Data Facility](https://eidf.ed.ac.uk/)) or a cloud provider such as Vast.ai (rented GPU instances). 

Each experiment is described by a **row in a CSV file** (see `./experiments/` for example CSV files). 

The pipeline generator (`./pipeline/generator.py`) turns each row in given CSV file into something you can launch:

- **K8s cluster (e.g. EIDF)** → one Kubernetes Job YAML per row. Submit it; it runs unattended and
  pushes its own results.
- **Vast.ai** → one bash launch script per (family, engine, GPU) group. Run it; it rents an instance, runs every row in that group, pushes results, and
  destroys itself.


---
## 2. Prerequisites

### Everywhere

Generation needs a Python environment with `pandas` and `pyyaml`. Run the generator **from inside the git repo** (it embeds the TEASBench commit for provenance).

### K8s only

- `kubectl` configured for your project namespace 
- These cluster secrets must exist:

| Secret | Key | Needed for |
|---|---|---|
| `gemini-api-key` | `key` | judge for `imo-answerbench` |
| `openrouter-api-key` | `key` | judge for `mcp-atlas` (`kubectl create secret generic openrouter-api-key --from-literal=key=...`) |
| `mcp-atlas-github-token` | `token` | `mcp-atlas` tool servers |
| `mcp-atlas-brave-api-key` | `key` | `mcp-atlas` tool servers |

**SWE-bench Lite**

SWE-bench Lite needs a Python environment on the login node and several environment variables set. One script builds it, once:

```bash
bash pipeline/k8s/setup/setup_swebench_env.sh
```

  This installs `agent_cap`, `swe-rex` and `swebench` into a Python venv, clones SWE-agent and applies
  and verifies AgentCAP's streaming patch, then writes `env.sh` (environment setup) and `versions.json` (recorded into each run's metadata). 
  
On EIDF and other clusters that do not grant pods role-based access control (RBAC), SWE-bench Lite benchmarks are launched not as an unattended K8s Job but using a bash driver script on the login node that can be run interactively or backgrounded - see [§4.6](#46-preflight-check-for-portforwardk8sprovider-mode-clusters-without-pod-rbac) and [§4.7](#47-swe-bench-lite-on-a-k8s-cluster). Note only one driver script (i.e. one SWE-bench run) should be run at any given time within a K8s namespace.

> On EIDF and other clusters that do not grant pods RBAC, SWE-bench experiments are run using TEASBench's `PortForwardK8sProvider` mechanism described in [§4.6](#46-preflight-check-for-portforwardk8sprovider-mode-clusters-without-pod-rbac) and [§4.7](#47-swe-bench-lite-on-a-k8s-cluster). On clusters that permit RBAC the alternative `InClusterK8sProvider` mechanism is available - see [§4.5](#45-preflight-check-for-inclusterk8sprovider-mode-clusters-that-grant-pod-rbac), however this has not been tested. 

### Vast.ai only

- `vastai` CLI installed and authenticated ([§5.2](#52-vastai-setup))
- Instance secrets set in the Vast.ai console ([§5.2](#52-vastai-setup))
- The container images built and pushed if using non-default ([§5.2](#56-building-one-of-the-images))

---

## 3. The experiments CSV

Predefined validated benchmark parameters are provided in CSV files in [`./experiments/`](./experiments/).

One file is marked differently. `moe-experiments-vastai-beta.csv` holds the B200 and B300
coordinates behind published results, reconstructed from those runs' own records. **Beta means it
has not been re-executed through this pipeline**, unlike the other CSVs here the rows describe
hardware we measured on, not a matrix we have re-run end to end. Marketplace supply and price move
constantly, and the largest node sizes are the thinnest, so each generated script opens by searching
for matching offers: read what that returns before committing to a run.


**MoE:**

Ordered column header fields headers that define an MoE experiment:

```
family,inference_engine,model,dataset,num_samples,gpu,num_gpu,batch_size,input_length,output_length
```

Example row for an MoE experiment:

```
moe,sglang,gpt-oss-120b,gsm8k,256,A100,1,default
```

> Note: `input_length` and `output_length` are optional and only used for fixed-length mode as referenced in [TEASBench Insights](https://www.teasbench.com/insights))

**Agentic:**

Ordered column header fields that define an agentic experiment:

```
family,benchmark,inference_engine,model,gpu,num_gpu,num_tasks,concurrency,batch_size
```

Example row for an agentic experiment:

```
agentic,swe-bench-lite,sglang,gpt-oss-120b,H100,2,100,4,default
```

## 4. Running on K8s cluster
### 4.1 Generate

```bash
cd pipeline
python3 generate.py --csv_file=../experiments/moe-experiments-eidf.csv
```

Options: 

* `--target_dir` specifies where to output job yaml files generated (default `./`)
* `--results_repo` specifies a repository to which to commit results (default
`TEAS_Development_Results_Private`).
* `--site` selects which cluster to generate for (default `eidf`) — see below.

**Targeting a different cluster.** Everything specific to one cluster — namespace,
Kueue queue, PVC names, GPU node labels, model staging root, whether pods are
granted RBAC — lives in a site profile at
[`pipeline/configs/sites/<site>.yaml`](./pipeline/configs/sites/). Nothing else in
the pipeline names a cluster. To run on another K8s cluster, copy
[`eidf.yaml`](./pipeline/configs/sites/eidf.yaml), edit the values, and pass
`--site <name>`; no code changes are needed. The site name is also the directory
results are published under, so keep it distinct per cluster.

Generate creates one YAML per row, named after the run:

```
sglang-gptoss120b-gsm8k-ns256-a100x1-bsd.yaml
sglang-gptoss120b-swe-bench-lite-nt100-h100x2.yaml
```

### 4.2 Submit

```bash
./submit_job.sh sglang-gptoss120b-gsm8k-ns256-a100x1-bsd.yaml
```

This creates the Job, copies the job yaml to a job-config-dir, and appends the name to `submitted_jobs.log`. You will need to run `submit_job.sh` and set JOB\_CONFIGS\_DIR to a location that is accessible from your job so that it can copy and store (commit) the job yaml alongside the results for the sake of provenance. 

You can submit several jobs by looping, i.e.:

```bash
for f in out/*.yaml; do ./submit_job.sh "$f"; done
```

### 4.3 Watch

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get jobs
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -w
kubectl -n <namespace> logs -f <pod>
```

Helpers in [`pipeline/k8s/helpers/`](../pipeline/k8s/helpers/): `k8_pod_log.sh`,
`k8_job_desc.sh`, `k8_pod_bash_login.sh`.

For SWE-bench Lite you will also see transient sandbox pods appear and vanish:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -l app=teasbench-sandbox
```

### 4.4 Agentic specifics

**IMO AnswerBench**: nothing extra; one container.

**MCP Atlas**: the pod gets a second container (the tool server) on port 1984.
Check both:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> logs <pod> -c mcp-atlas-sidecar
```

**SWE-bench Lite**: *not* an unattended Job on a cluster without pod RBAC (EIDF
among them). See [§4.7](#47-swe-bench-lite-on-a-k8s-cluster): the driver runs
on a login node and creates the Jobs itself. The GPUs are still used through a
Kubernetes Job, as always, only the driver process sits outside the cluster.

### 4.5 Preflight check for InClusterK8sProvider mode (clusters that grant pod RBAC)

> **Only for clusters that grant pods RBAC.** It tests `InClusterK8sProvider`,
> which needs that. EIDF does not grant it, so skip this section there and go to
> [§4.6](#46-preflight-check-for-portforwardk8sprovider-mode-clusters-without-pod-rbac)
> (mechanism check) and [§4.7](#47-swe-bench-lite-on-a-k8s-cluster) (running it).

In-cluster SWE-bench depends on two facts about the cluster that are worth
confirming *before* a GPU job queues, because both fail late and confusingly:

1. **Pod IPs are routable within the namespace**, the driver talks to a sandbox
   at `http://<podIP>:9999` with no port-forward. A restrictive NetworkPolicy
   breaks this.
2. **`kubectl` works in-cluster from the ServiceAccount token**, with no
   kubeconfig, and the RBAC grants the verbs the provider uses.

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> create -f pipeline/k8s/preflight/teasbench-preflight.yaml
kubectl -n <namespace> logs -f job/teasbench-preflight
```

The preflight does exactly what `InClusterK8sProvider.acquire()` does; same
kubectl bootstrap, same Job-spec shape, same jsonpath to read the pod IP, same
port, but against a busybox target instead of a multi-GB SWE-bench image, and
with **no GPU**. It schedules immediately and costs no GPU time.

Expected output:

```
  PASS  kubectl v1.xx.x installed
  PASS  kubectl authenticates and can list pods
  PASS  can create jobs
  ...
  PASS  read pod IP via the provider's jsonpath: 10.42.3.17
  PASS  pod IP is routable on port 9999 -- no port-forward needed
ALL CHECKS PASSED -- in-cluster mode is good to go.
```

It exits non-zero on any failure and names which assumption broke. Two quick
manual cross-checks if you want them independently:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get networkpolicy          # empty = nothing blocking pod-to-pod
kubectl -n <namespace> auth can-i create jobs \
        --as=system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:teasbench-runner
```

The second impersonates the ServiceAccount from your own session, so it checks
the RBAC without running anything. Note it needs impersonation rights, which not
every project grants, the preflight Job needs none, since it *is* the
ServiceAccount.

If the routability check fails, in-cluster mode is unusable on this cluster; use
`PortForwardK8sProvider` [§4.6](#46-preflight-check-for-portforwardk8sprovider-mode-clusters-without-pod-rbac), which needs neither assumption.

### 4.6 Preflight check for PortForwardK8sProvider mode (clusters without pod RBAC)

Everything SWE-bench does on a K8s cluster without pod RBAC (EIDF among them) rests on `PortForwardK8sProvider`, so check it
before committing GPU time. This runs **on a login node**, not as a Job, because
that is where the provider itself runs. It uses your own kubectl credentials and
needs no ServiceAccount and no RBAC manifest, which is exactly why this is the
path such a cluster can support.

**Fast probe** (~1 min, no GPU):

```bash
python3 pipeline/k8s/preflight/preflight_portforward.py --namespace <namespace>
```

It drives the **real** `PortForwardK8sProvider` OS port allocation, the
`kubectl port-forward` spawn, the readiness poll, the tunnel-babysitter thread
and cleanup on release, plus the `kubectl cp` / `kubectl exec` path the
SWE-bench evaluator uses.

A `kubectl port-forward` that dies quietly mid-task is the failure the
babysitter thread exists to prevent, and the one that would otherwise surface as
an inexplicable task failure deep into a long run.

The permission unique to this path is `create pods/portforward`; the in-cluster
provider never needs it, because it talks to pod IPs directly.

**Full-fidelity probe** (minutes, still no GPU):

```bash
python3 pipeline/k8s/preflight/preflight_portforward.py --namespace <namespace> --real-image
```

`--real-image` drops the busybox substitution for a genuine
`docker.io/swebench/sweb.eval.x86_64.*` image, additionally proving the multi-GB
pull works and that `swe-rex` installs and runs inside the instance image, an
old conda env where a dependency clash is plausible. Pass an instance id to
override the default (`--real-image django__django-11099`).

### 4.7 SWE-bench Lite on a K8s cluster

On a cluster that **does not grant pods RBAC** — EIDF among them — SWE-bench
always uses `PortForwardK8sProvider`, with the **driver** running on a login
node. This is the validated path; the in-cluster alternative is [§4.5](#45-preflight-check-for-inclusterk8sprovider-mode-clusters-that-grant-pod-rbac).

#### Where everything actually runs

The driver moving off the cluster does **not** mean Kubernetes is bypassed. The
model runs on GPUs through a Job, exactly as every other TEASBench run does.
Four components, three of them Kubernetes Jobs, all created with *your*
credentials, and all of it handled for you:

| Component | Where | GPU | Created by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Driver** (`agent_cap.agents`) | login-node VM | no | you, by running the generated script |
| **Engine** (sglang/vllm serving the model) | Kubernetes Job | **yes** | the driver, at start-up |
| **Sandbox** (swe-rex, one per task) | Kubernetes Job | no | the driver, at run time |
| **Eval** (official grading) | Kubernetes Job | no | the driver, at run time |

The driver reaches the engine and each sandbox over `kubectl port-forward`.

Why this is allowed when in-cluster mode is not: *you* may create Jobs and
port-forward, and [§4.6](#46-preflight-check-for-portforwardk8sprovider-mode-clusters-without-pod-rbac) confirms both. What such a cluster refuses is granting those
rights to a **pod's ServiceAccount**. Running the driver as yourself sidesteps
that entirely.

IMO AnswerBench and MCP Atlas are unaffected and still run as ordinary
unattended Jobs, because neither touches the Kubernetes API.

#### Running it

The pipeline handles all of it, including the engine. Generation emits **two**
files for a SWE-bench row on such a cluster instead of one:

```bash
cd pipeline
python3 generate.py \
    --csv_file=../experiments/swe-bench-lite-eidf.csv --target_dir=./out
```

```
sglang-gptoss120b-swe-bench-lite-nt100-h200x1.sh           <- driver script 
sglang-gptoss120b-swe-bench-lite-nt100-h200x1.engine.yaml  <- driver script submits for you
```

Any shell that wants to launch the driver script to run an `swe-bench-lite` experiment must first source the resulting environment initialisation script:

```
source ~/teasbench-env/env.sh
```

Then start it and walk away:

```bash
bash out/sglang-gptoss120b-swe-bench-lite-nt100-h200x1.sh
```

The script checks prerequisites, submits the engine Job, waits for the model to
load, opens and babysits the tunnel, runs the benchmark (retrying tasks that
were only lost to a dropped tunnel, see below), checks the run is complete
enough to publish, pushes the results, and **deletes the engine Job on exit**;
success, failure or Ctrl-C. This means an aborted run cannot leave GPUs
allocated. You never start an engine or submit the engine manifest by hand.

> **Run one driver at a time per namespace.** On the `PortForwardK8sProvider`
> path, do not start a second SWE-bench run in the same namespace while one is
> already going. The driver cleans up sandbox Jobs by label
> (`app=teasbench-sandbox`), which is namespace-wide and carries nothing
> identifying which run owns them — so one run's cleanup, whether on exit,
> Ctrl-C or between retry attempts, deletes the other run's **live** sandboxes.

Useful flags: `--no-push`, `--namespace`, `--output-root`.

The driver contains **no install paths of its own**: `TEASBENCH_ROOT`,
`AGENTCAP_DIR`, `SWEAGENT_DIR` and the interpreter all come from `env.sh`, and it
refuses to start if that has not been sourced. A generated script is therefore
portable between machines: relocate a checkout and re-run the setup script rather
than editing anything generated.

#### Retrying dropped sandbox tunnels

An incidental dropped `kubectl port-forward` tunnel to a sandbox kills the task using it. To compensate for this, the runs the client in a bounded retry loop controlled by`MAX_ATTEMPTS`, which defaults to `50` - deliberately far above what a healthy run needs: the loop is meant to end when the retry list is empty, and a no-progress guard stops it as soon as an attempt fails to shrink that list. 

After each attempt and while attempts remain the driver decides which tasks to retry. Only tasks with positive evidence of an infrastructure failure - a tunnel drop seen by the babysitter after it was already up, a `k8s sidecar failed:`
error, a tunnel-drop signature in the SWE-agent logs - are retried. A task the agent itself gave up on — ran out of cost, format, or context budget, or finished and submitted nothing — is never retried; doing so would give it a second sample and bias accuracy upward. 

#### Completeness gate

Before pushing anything, the driver runs `swebench_run_audit report`, which
writes `$RUN_DIR/completeness.json` and exits non-zero if any task is still
infrastructure-incomplete after the retry loop, or if `predictions.json` /
`eval_k8s_results.json` are short of the number of patched tasks in
`results.jsonl`. 

**A failed gate means nothing is published.** The script exits 1 without
pushing — the engine Job is still torn down first, since the `EXIT` trap runs
regardless, so a gate failure costs no stranded GPU time. Everything stays in
`$RUN_DIR`; inspect `completeness.json` for exactly which tasks are still
incomplete and why, then decide by hand whether to re-run or push manually.

A run directory for a `PortForwardK8sProvider` SWE-bench run now additionally
contains:

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `portforward-events.jsonl` | the drop journal — one JSON line per tunnel start/drop/restart/release event, engine and sandbox tunnels alike |
| `portforward/` | per-sandbox `kubectl port-forward` stderr, one log per task (previously discarded to `/dev/null`) |
| `completeness.json` | the completeness report written by the gate above |
| `results.attempt-N.jsonl` | `results.jsonl` as it stood before attempt `N+1`'s retries — one archive per retried attempt |

#### Provenance

After the run the driver stamps `versions.json` into every `metadata_*.json`, so
a directory in the results repo records the exact code that produced it without
reference to anything outside it.


#### Smoke test first

The 2-task row in `experiments/agentic-smoke-tests-eidf.csv` is the same thing at
small scale; same driver, same engine Job, same sandboxes, same grading:

```bash
cd pipeline
python3 generate.py \
    --csv_file=../experiments/agentic-smoke-tests-eidf.csv --target_dir=./out
bash out/vllm-gptoss120b-swe-bench-lite-nt2-a100x1.sh
```

A low or zero accuracy on 2 tasks is normal and not a failure signal; what
matters is that every stage ran and wrote its outputs.

**Run [§4.6](#46-preflight-check-for-portforwardk8sprovider-mode-clusters-without-pod-rbac) first:  if the mechanism is broken, this fails for that reason after queueing for a GPU.**


## 5. Running MoE benchmarks on Vast.ai

On the Vast.ai cloud provider, the pipelines are provided in two parts:

1) Local Python scripts to set up and submit jobs, very similarly to Kubernetes/EIDF runs.
2) Container images to be run in Vast.ai instances containing the software required to perform the benchmarks.

These containers are derived from the same official vLLM and SGLang images used on the Kubernetes pipeline, but we add
the extra software and scripting needed to automate benchmark runs and result pushes to GitHub. We also bake the same
resolution logic for environment and MoE/Agent-CAP server/client launch commands into the images, to ensure that a
Vast.ai run will have the same setup. Once a container instance is running on a GPU node, it will run through the set of
benchmarks it is provided with, one-by-one, and push the results to GitHub. Runtime parameters (namely which benchmarks
are to be run) are passed to the instance via environment variables passed through the Vast.ai CLI. Similarly, Vast.ai
must be set up to provide API keys and GitHub PATs to the environment within instances, as required by the specific
benchmarks being run.

### 5.1 Local prerequisites

For Vast.ai, you will need an account with credit and an API key with instances read/write permissions. You can follow
the [Vast.ai documentation](https://docs.vast.ai/cli/) to create the key, install the CLI, and log in.
The Vast.ai pipeline uses the CLI to search for offers and launch instances; from that point on, a benchmark run will manage itself.

Otherwise, you will not need any extra Python packages beyond those required to run the generation scripts as described
above: `pyyaml` and `pandas`.

### 5.2 Vast.ai setup

To allow the various tools in the TEASBench pipeline to access external services, you will need to set up some
environment variables in your Vast.ai account. These are injected into any instance you launch, and are used by the
TEASBench pipeline to access GitHub, HuggingFace, OpenAI, and other services. You can add these through the web
interface or via the CLI

You will also need to set up the following environment variables within your Vast.ai account:
- `GIT_TOKEN` — a GitHub personal access token with repo write access, to push results to the results repository.
- `HF_TOKEN` — a HuggingFace token, to download models from the Hugging Face Hub.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — an OpenAI API key, providing a judge.

If you are running the agentic benchmarks, you will additionally need these three environment variables:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — a Gemini API key, providing a judge.
- `MODAL_TOKEN_ID` — a Modal API token ID, providing access to Modal sandboxes for SWE-Bench.
- `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET` — a Modal API token secret, providing access to Modal sandboxes for SWE-Bench.

If you wish to reproduce the full set of TEASBench results, then you will also need to set the following for
MCP-Atlas runs in order to enable the GitHub and Brave tool servers:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — a GitHub personal access token with repo read access
- `BRAVE_API_KEY` — a Brave API key, providing access to the Brave tool server

In summary:

| Environment variable                   | Purpose                           | Required by       |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| `GIT_TOKEN`                            | Push results to repo              | everything        |
| `HF_TOKEN`                             | Download models from Hugging Face | everything        |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`                       | Judge result accuracy             | `arena-hard`      |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`                       | Judge result accuracy             | `imo-answerbench` |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`                   | Judge result accuracy             | `mcp-atlas`       |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `BRAVE_API_KEY`        | Tool server API keys (see below)  | `mcp-atlas`       |
| `MODAL_TOKEN_ID`, `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET` | Run Modal sandboxes               | `swe-bench-lite`  |

You can set these on Vast.ai either through the command line interface or the web console. Vast.ai then automatically
exports them as environment variables in instances for the TEASBench pipeline to use for service access during benchmark
runs.

With regard to MCP-Atlas tool servers, `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `BRAVE_API_KEY` are not strictly required; without them, the
benchmark will progress with the tools that do not require API keys. However, as the original TEASBench results included
these two tools, any reproduction should also provide them.

### 5.3 Vast.ai workflow

The same workflow is used for both MoE/basic and agentic benchmark suites.

When running on Vast.ai using the TEASBench-provided images at `ghcr.io/teas-project`, you will generally
follow these steps:

1. Prepare an experiment CSV file describing the benchmarks you want to run, examples of which can be found in the root
   `experiments/` directory. Each CSV can describe MoE/basic or agentic benchmarks.
2. Run the pipeline `generate.py` script locally:
   ```bash
    python3 generate.py --csv_file <path to experiment CSV> --site vastai
   ```
   You may optionally provide a `--target_dir` argument to specify where the output should be generated.
   Depending on the contents of the CSV, one or more bash scripts will be created, each corresponding to one
   engine/GPU/numGPU combination from the CSV. The `generate.py` output will tell you these scripts' names and how many
   rows from the original CSV have been included in each.
3. Run the generated bash script(s), for example the very simple
   ```bash
   bash ./vast_agentic_mcp-atlas_sglang_H100x2.sh
   ```
   would have been generated to run the agentic MCP-Atlas with SGLang on 2 H100 GPUs. Vast.ai will be called to provide
   a list of offers matching the hardware needed by the given script (in this example H100x1), sorting them in order of
   increasing price.
4. You will prompted to enter the offer number of your choice. Do so, and Vast.ai will reserve the instance and launch
   the container, passing to it a base64 encoding of the relevant rows from the original CSV file. The container will
   run the benchmarks, pushing results to GitHub as it goes. You can monitor the progress of the benchmarks through the
   logs on the CLI or on the Vast.ai web interface.
5. In normal operation, once all benchmarks from the corresponding rows of the original CSV have completed, the instance
   will shut itself down.

### 5.4 Manually terminating a run

Normally, a Vast.ai instance will restart if it ends for any reason. In order to get around this and not restart (and so
re-run the benchmarks indefinitely), the benchmarking script will call the Vast.ai API to shut down its own instance.
If multiple attempts to reach Vast.ai's API endpoint fail, the instance will run `sleep infinity`. You may wish to check
any long running instances to ensure they are still working have not gone to sleep. If they have done so, end the
instance manually; your results should still have been pushed to the remote repository.

### 5.5 Differences from a Kubernetes cluster run

There are some architectural differences to note between the pipeline site types for agentic benchmarks:

- MCP-Atlas runs tool servers in a sidecar pod on Kubernetes clusters. Vast.ai runs simply run them in the background on
  the same container.
- SWE-Bench sandboxes and grading are carried in Kubernetes pods and exec pods on Kubernetes clusters. On Vast.ai, Modal
  is used; this is swe-rex native.

### 5.6 Building one of the images

Four container images are provided via the GitHub Container Registry:

| Image name                            | Dockerfile                  | Purpose                          |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `ghcr.io/teas-project/vllm-bench`     | `vllm/Dockerfile`           | Basic/MoE benchmarks with vLLM   |
| `ghcr.io/teas-project/sglang-bench`   | `sglang/Dockerfile`         | Basic/MoE benchmarks with SGLang |
| `ghcr.io/teas-project/vllm-agentic`   | `vllm/Dockerfile.agentic`   | Agentic benchmarks with vLLM     |
| `ghcr.io/teas-project/sglang-agentic` | `sglang/Dockerfile.agentic` | Agentic benchmarks with SGLang   |

The general method to build an image is to run in the base `TEASBench` directory e.g. with Podman:

```bash
podman build --platform=linux/amd64 --build-arg TEASBENCH_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) -t ghcr.io/teas-project/vllm-bench:latest -f pipeline/vast/vllm/Dockerfile pipeline/
```

The images include components of the pipeline templating code, required to ensure that the benchmark server and client
commands run exactly as they do in Kubernetes/EIDF runs.

If you wish to build your own images, you should change the tag `-t` option to reflect the container registry you wish
to use.

The images are also built automatically by the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/build-images.yml`:
every push to `main` that touches `pipeline/` builds all four and pushes them to GHCR tagged `:latest` and
`:sha-<short-commit>`; pull requests build (and smoke test) the images without pushing. The image owner is taken from
the repository owner, so the same workflow pushes to `ghcr.io/<your-user>/...` when run on a fork. Note that for the
workflow to push to an existing package, the package's settings on GitHub must grant the repository write access
(package → Package settings → Manage Actions access).

## 6. Troubleshooting

### 6.1 SWE-bench Lite permissions (if using InClusterK8sProvider) 

If sandbox creation fails with a `kubectl` permissions error, either apply
`pipeline/k8s/rbac/teasbench-runner-rbac.yaml`, or switch to the login-node fallback by
pointing the run at `PortForwardK8sProvider` instead of `InClusterK8sProvider` 
that provider uses *your* kubectl credentials via port-forwarding rather than
the pod's ServiceAccount. Confirm it works first with [§4.6](#46-preflight-check-for-portforwardk8sprovider-mode-clusters-without-pod-rbac).

### 6.2 MCP Atlas scores lower than expected

**Check the credential log first.** Tool servers with blank API keys still start
and fail only at tool-call time, so missing credentials look like poor model
performance. The run logs which keys were supplied and which were empty (names
only, never values):

```
credentials supplied: BRAVE_API_KEY GITHUB_TOKEN
left empty: ALCHEMY_API_KEY EXA_API_KEY ...
```

Also confirm the server set matches, it is pinned to the same 22 servers on
both platforms, because the server set *is* the benchmark definition.

---

## 7. Where results go

```
<family>/<platform>/<engine>/<model>/<dataset-or-benchmark>/<gpu_type>x<num_gpu>/batch-size-<default-or-1>/<timestamp>/
```

Example paths:

```
moe/eidf/sglang/gpt-oss-120b/gsm8k_256samples/a100x1/batch-size-default/20260727-1432/
agentic/vastai/sglang/gpt-oss-120b/swe-bench-lite/h200x1/batch-size-default/20260727-1432/
```

Each timestamped run directory holds `metrics_*.json`, `metadata_*.json`,
`detailed-results_*.jsonl`, `output-data_*.jsonl`, `timings.json`, the job YAML and/or driver run script
or provenance, and logs.

Aggregate with:

```bash
python3 postprocessing/aggregate_results.py --results_dir <repo>/moe
```

Point `--results_dir` at the `moe` or `agentic` subdirectory, **not** the repo
root.

---

## 8. Common tasks

**Smoke test before a real sweep**

```bash
cd pipeline
python3 generate.py --csv_file=../experiments/moe-smoke-tests-eidf.csv --target_dir=./out
python3 generate.py --csv_file=../experiments/agentic-smoke-tests-eidf.csv --target_dir=./out
```

**Add a model**

Add to `HF_MODEL_MAP`, `MODEL_SHORT_NAME_MAP` and (for
Vast.ai) `MODEL_DISK_GB_MAP` in `pipeline/utils.py`.

**Add a GPU or other device** 

Add it to `gpu_products` in the relevant site profile
(`pipeline/configs/sites/<site>.yaml`), plus `TEAS_GPU_NAME_MAP` in
`pipeline/utils.py`. For a K8s site the value is the `nvidia.com/gpu.product`
node label; for Vast.ai, take the string from `vastai search offers`.

**Change inference engine, client, environment, or other parameters for one case** 

Add a rule to `pipeline/configs/config.yaml`. Rules match on any parameter or combinations of parameters (`benchmark`,
`platform`, `gpu`, `model`, `inference_engine`, …); more specific rules override
more general ones.

**Change agent sampling parameters** 

Edit the relevant
`pipeline/configs/agents/<benchmark>_<model>_<engine>.yaml`.

**Verify you haven't broken anything**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -q
```

## 9. Support for emerging hardware 

### Tenstorrent 

Currently the TEASBench pipeline does not support running the TEASBench benchmarks on Tenstorrent accelerators due to limited [Tenstorrent inference engine model support](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-inference-server/blob/main/docs/model_support/llm/README.md). As model support matures we expect to extend the pipeline to target Tenstorrent hardware building on [our approach](./pipeline/dev/tenstorrent/README.md) running a simpler dense model, Llama3.1-8b-Instruct, on a Tenstorrent Blackhole p150b served using [`pipeline/dev/tenstorrent/tt-llm-run.sh`](./pipeline/dev/tenstorrent/tt-llm-run.sh), which serves as a concrete example based on the documentation on [how to deploy LLMs using tt-inference](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/getting-started/vLLM-servers.html). 

Note: [https://www.teasbench.com](https://www.teasbench.com) includes benchmark results for `qwen3-4B` -  another dense model - on Tenstorrent Blackhole p150, however this was produced using custom kernels under development rather than the publicly available Tenstorrent software stack (`tt-inference`) available at time of writing (August 2026).
